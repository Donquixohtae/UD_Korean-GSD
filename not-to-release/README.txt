Universal Dependencies - Google UD Korean Treebank
https://github.com/universaldependencies/ud_korean
===============================================================================

INTRODUCTION

The Google UD Korean Treebank is derived from the Korean portion of the Google 
Universal Dependency Treebanks v2.0:

https://github.com/ryanmcd/uni-dep-tb

On top of the original treebank, it includes automatic tags from the 
morphological analyzer developed by Do-Gil Lee:

Probabilistic Modeling of Korean Morphology, Do-Gil Lee and Hae-Chang Rim
IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 17(5):945-955

Distinguished from the original treebank, certain symbols such as quotes or 
periods are separated as individual tokens in this treebank.
